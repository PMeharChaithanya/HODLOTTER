                        <p class="story-text emotional">"Dad, why are you crying?" Those were the words Oliver's 7-year-old daughter asked when she found him staring at his crypto portfolio on that dark November morning in 2022. His $350,000 life savings... now worth just $3,500. The college funds, the dream house down payment, his mother's medical treatment money... all gone in the LUNA/UST crash. 💔</p>
                        
                        <p class="story-text deep-emotional">The next few months were a blur of pain. Sleepless nights. Endless anxiety. The shame of telling his wife they had to move back in with his parents. The heartbreak of explaining to his daughter why they had to sell her beloved puppy. His crypto community? They vanished like his gains. No support. No guidance. Just countless "WAGMI" messages from anonymous avatars who didn't really care. 😢</p>
                        
                        <div class="story-quote">
                            "I trusted the wrong people. I believed in projects that turned out to be houses of cards. I was part of communities that were nothing but pump and dump groups in disguise. The crypto space had lost its soul." - Oliver, December 2022
                        </div>
                        
                        <p class="story-text highlight">Then came the FTX collapse. More lives destroyed. More dreams shattered. Oliver watched as friends lost homes, marriages crumbled, and some even contemplated the unthinkable. That's when he realized: crypto didn't need another token. It needed a family. A real one. 🙏</p>
                        
                        <p class="story-text deep-emotional">Why otters? Because in nature, when river waters turn deadly cold, otters don't just survive - they thrive. They form living chains, sharing warmth, protecting the young and elderly. No otter left behind. No otter forgotten. While wolves fight alone, otters understand: true strength lies in unity. 🦦</p>
